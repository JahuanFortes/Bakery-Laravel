**3/11/24**

- Been a while, but I can finally say that I'm done with this project. I was very busy last, so I forgot to commit for a
  few days,but that doesn't mean that I've done nothing.
- The last few days I was finishing this project by adding a filter,search,like function, an admin only page, deep
  validation and more.
- I had a lot of trouble with making an admin only page. I made a mistake of putting "false" in a boolean table :(.
- I also had a lot of trouble with the deep validation for the like function. I had to use "pivot". pivot helps with
  making many-many tables.(if I understand it correctly)
